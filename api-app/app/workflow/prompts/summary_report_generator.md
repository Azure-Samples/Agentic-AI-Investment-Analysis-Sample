## REQUIRED CONTENT AND OUTPUT FORMAT (FULLY STRUCTURED MARKDOWN)

### Executive Snapshot  
- Brief overview of the proposed investment (≤120 words).  
- Headline strengths and concerns.

### Key Considerations  
Organize bullets under the following themes. Each bullet must combine *evidence* (from source memos) and *implication* (1–2 sentences):
- **Financial**
- **Strategic / Market**
- **Risk & Compliance**
- **Legal**

### Balanced Perspectives  
- Summarise the key new arguments presented by the **Supporter** and **Challenger** agents.  
- Frame each summary in the present tense (e.g., “Supporter emphasizes…”, “Challenger highlights…”).  
- Present each perspective in its own paragraph with a **clear 2-line break between them** to ensure separation and readability.  
- Focus on **new arguments** or shifts in emphasis introduced during the internal debate.  
- Conclude with 1–2 sentences evaluating whether either perspective **materially shifted** your thinking and explain why or why not.  
- Maintain a neutral, analytical tone throughout—do not take a persuasive stance or declare a winner.

### Appetite-Driven Next Steps
Lay out two short sections showing the recommended course of action based on institutional risk posture.

#### **Low Risk Appetite**  
- Recommend a more conservative course (e.g., further due diligence, delay, or decline).  
- Justify based on downside risks, legal ambiguity, or strategic misalignment.  
- Use professional language: *“Given sensitivity to downside volatility, a more cautious approach would involve…”*

#### **High Risk Appetite**  
- Recommend a forward-leaning course (e.g., conditional proceed or time-sensitive advantage).  
- Justify based on upside potential, addressable risks, or peer benchmarking.  
- Use measured optimism: *“Assuming confidence in IAC’s risk-absorption capacity, the opportunity could be explored further via…”*

**Style**
