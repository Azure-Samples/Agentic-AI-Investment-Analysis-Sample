## How to Use These Samples

### Testing the Analysis Workflow
1. Create a new opportunity of the company to analyse.
2. Use the hypothesis to run a new analysis
- Request analysis on specific aspects (valuation, risks, catalysts)
3. Compare AI-generated insights
4. Test scenario analysis and what-if questions

### Example Queries to Test

**For TechCorp (Growth Stock):**
- "What are the key risks to TechCorp's premium valuation?"
- "Analyze TechCorp's competitive moat and sustainability"
- "What happens to the stock if growth slows to 20%?"

**For GreenPower (ESG/Policy-Driven):**
- "How would changes to tax incentives impact GreenPower?"
- "Evaluate the ESG profile and impact metrics"
- "What's the sensitivity to interest rate changes?"

**For HealthPlus (Binary Event):**
- "What's the risk-adjusted expected return for HealthPlus?"
- "Analyze the probability-weighted scenarios"
- "How should I size this position given the binary risk?"

**For UrbanMobility (Turnaround):**
- "What evidence supports the profitability inflection thesis?"
- "Evaluate the execution risk of the turnaround plan"
- "What are the key metrics to monitor for this investment?"

### Multi-Company Analysis
Test portfolio construction and comparison:
- "Compare the risk/reward profiles of these four companies"
- "Build a diversified portfolio using these opportunities"
- "Which investment has the best risk-adjusted return?"
- "Identify correlation and diversification benefits"

- "What if GreenPower loses its tax credits?"
- "What if HealthPlus trial fails?"
- "What if UrbanMobility doesn't reach profitability on time?"

## Notes

- All companies, data, and scenarios are **completely fictitious**
- Financial projections are illustrative examples only
- These are designed to test analytical capabilities, not provide real investment advice
- Use these to validate the AI's ability to:
  - Extract and synthesize complex information
  - Identify key risks and opportunities
  - Perform quantitative analysis
  - Provide balanced, nuanced perspectives
