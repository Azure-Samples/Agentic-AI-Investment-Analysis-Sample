GreenPower Energy Solutions Analysis Hypothesis

GreenPower's transition to profitability in Q3 2024 combined with expanding gross margins to 25% and favorable regulatory tailwinds from the Inflation Reduction Act 
support a 45% upside to $52 per share. The company's industry-leading installation costs of $2.20/watt versus $2.65/watt industry average, 
along with 50% annual installation growth targets, position it to capture significant market share as U.S. solar penetration increases from 6% to projected 15% by 2030. 
Critical catalysts to validate include Q4 2024 margin expansion, announcement of strategic battery supply partnership in Q1 2025, and successful entry into 3 new state 
markets while maintaining positive unit economics.
